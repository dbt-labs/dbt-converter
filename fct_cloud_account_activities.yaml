name: fct_cloud_account_activities
description: "This model helps BI users calculate daily, weekly, and monthly active
  account metrics on top of our Cloud account activity data. Activity metrics are
  measured the `fct_web_pageviews` (for general activity), `fct_cloud_ide_sessions`
  for IDE sessions/development usage, and `dbt_docs_sessions` for docs usage/activity.
  This follows similar logic as our other existing activity models (e.g. `fct_dbt_project_activty`
  and `fct_slack_user_account_activity`).\n\nNote: This only contains verified accounts
  (i.e. Cloud Accounts with at least one verified user, meaning they verified their
  email). This removes any spam accounts from this model."
