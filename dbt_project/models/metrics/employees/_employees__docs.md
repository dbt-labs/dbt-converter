{% docs forecasted_headcount %}
A count of hired employees out of the hiring opportunities.

## Context
The goal here is to ensure that we're following our forecasted headcount plan for each quarter. Meaning that we hit our hiring targets every quarter.

## Calculations
* **Actual Headcount per Quarter:** Total New Hires by Quarter
* **Planned Headcount per Quarter:** Total Planned New Hires by Quarter
* **Headcount Accuracy:**  `Count of Quarters w. Reached Headcount / Completed Quarters`
