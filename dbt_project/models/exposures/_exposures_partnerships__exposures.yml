    description: >
      This is a S3 bucket in the dbt-sandbox AWS instance that we read and write to. 
      We have a storage integration in Snowflake called partner_5x_managed_dbt_cloud_S3 that
      handles the permissions to read and write to the S3 bucket. Our partner 5x is able to
      read from the bucket using an external IAM role that the infrastructure team created.
