{% docs src_crowdcast %}
**Status:** Inactive

We utilized Crowdcast as the event streaming platform for Coalesce in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, we switched to [Bizzabo](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/source_list/bizzabo), allowing us to combine registration and event streaming in one platform. This source is no longer updated, but is required for measuring historical Coalesce attendance.
