{% docs src_intercom %}
**Status:** Inactive

We started using Intercom in 2017 to May 20 2021. In May, we switched our support system to Zendesk. This source is no longer updated, but we need it for historical ticket and support chat data.

This source contains all Cloud support chat messages. These tables allow us to grab every chat message, requester, assignee, and even Cloud account information. Unlike Zendesk/Zendesk Support, you may view all chat history and ticket events within this source.

To understand how all of these tables connect together, please checkout [Fivetran's Intercom ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1K3HTGqNQ-neUNeTtjJq42RHBV68_4FuXFp8X81zJ5Xo/). If you'd like to view current tickets and chat history, please check out Zendesk and Zendesk Chat source documentation.
