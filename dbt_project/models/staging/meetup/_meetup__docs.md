We use the Meetup Pro platform to record all dbt Community events (online and in-person) across all of our geo hubs. This is a tap that we created ([see Tap Meetup Pro repo](https://github.com/dbt-labs/tap-meetup-pro)) and lives in Stitch. 

To understand the API of Meetup Pro, please check out [Meetup's API docs](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/).
