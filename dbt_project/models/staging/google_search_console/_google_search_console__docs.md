Google Search Console helps us monitor dbt Lab's website presence in Google Search results. We use data from this source to understand how search behavior (especially which keywords) are leading to traffic on our sites. This is largely used by our Acquisition Marketing team to improve our Search Engine Optimization (SEO) performance.

This data is being loaded by Fivetran and updates every 6 hours.
