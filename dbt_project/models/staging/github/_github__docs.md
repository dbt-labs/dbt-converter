{% docs src_github %}
**Status:** Active

At dbt Labs, we use Github for all code changes (e.g. dbt, dbt Cloud, Looker, Internal Analytics) and for vital company documentation that we want to version control (e.g. Employee Handbook, dbt and Looker Style Guides, etc). Github models are a great way to understand metrics around code review and who's submitting code for each repo.

To understand how these models interact with each other, we recommend checking out [Fivetran's Github ERD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lx6ez7-x-s-n2JCnCi3SjG4XMmx9ysNUvaNCaWc3I_I/edit#slide=id.g244d368397_0_1). We have to manually add each repository, so if you notice your repository is missing and you'd like to track it, please alert the Data team in #internal-analytics.
