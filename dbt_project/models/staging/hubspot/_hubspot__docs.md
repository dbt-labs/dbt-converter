Hubspot is a tool our marketing team users to send emails to members our contact list & manage website forms and content. Using the data from this platform, our team can better understand how emails are performing within a marketing campaign, which forms were downloaded the most, and which traffic sources lead to form downloads.

Data from Hubspot is currently being loaded via Fivetran. A large share of our Hubspot data models are built using [Fivetran's Hubspot package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_hubspot).
