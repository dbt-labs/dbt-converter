    description: >
      Union together the current messages (which don't include threads) with
      the flattened threads. Then union with historical messages, making sure
      there's no overlap between the two data sources.
      Note: because replies are initially captured as a field on original messages 
      and the data feed has a 30-day lookback window (on those original messages), 
      only replies received within that lookback are captured.
