We use [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) as our payment processor for accounts on the Team plan (i.e. Self-Service). It handles customers' subscription payments & invoicing.

<!------------------ STRIPE INVOICE LINE ITEMS ------------------>

<!---------- MODEL DOC ---------->
{% docs stripe_invoice_line_items %}
Invoice Line Items consist of all items charged within a single invoice. For example, in one invoice, it will consist of:
- The subscription (e.g. Team plan)
- The items within the subscription (e.g. 3 license Ã— Developer License (at $50.00 / month))
- Sales tax
- Invoiced items such as prorations or subscription upgrades
- and the associated revenue for each item.
    - subscription (Team plan x 3 seats): 150
    - subscription item (Team plan x 3 seats): 150
    - sales tax: 10.50
    - subscription upgrade: $43.33

Please note:
- If you sum the revenue per invoice, it will double count the cost of the subscription and the cost of the items within the subscription (see example above)

This model should only be used to look at the specific charges within an invoice.
If you want to aggregate the revenue from a self-service invoice, then we recommend using the `fct_stripe_invoices` model.
