This means that there is at least one user that has verified their email. We use this filter to remove any spam Cloud Accounts.\n\nActivation implies:\n* An account has connected a data warehouse\n* An account has connected a git repository\n* An account has run dbt 100 times in its first 14 days (i.e. 14 days after their Cloud Account was created.)\n\n## Calculations\n**Sources:**\n* **in dbt:** [fct_cloud_accounts](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/model/model.fishtown_internal_analytics.fct_cloud_accounts)\n* **in Looker:** [Cloud Accounts explore](https://fishtown.looker.com/explore/dbtLabs/cloud_accounts)\n\n**Formulas:**\n* **Verified Cloud Accounts:** Cloud Accounts that have at least one user that has a verified email.\n* **Activation Due Date:** 14 days after they created their account\n* Activated Cloud Accounts: Verified Cloud Accounts that connected their warehouse + Github repo _and_ reached 100+ invocations before or on their activation due date.\n* **% of Activated Accounts:** `Total Activated Cloud Accounts / Total Verified Cloud Accounts`\n## Resources\n* [Link to Data Asset](https://fishtown.looker.com/looks/380)\n* [Link to Googlesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJUNJGxv68ugT9VcTiTZthmBTNbXrnXygwHvputklNE/edit#gid=1594525499)\n* [Link to OKR Doc](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/O1-Differentiate-dbt-Cloud-b64d52ac2d4d4422912ec5af33f618d5)\n\n## Historical\n\n### Fiscal Year 2023 Overview\n* **Fiscal Year:** 2023\n* **Company Objective:** O1.
