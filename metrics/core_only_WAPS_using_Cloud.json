{"name": "core_only_WAPS_using_Cloud", "description": "## Definition\n* WAPs = Weekly Active Project. \"Active\" means a project ran an invocation (i.e. dbt run/build/test/etc in dbt Core and/or Cloud) within the past week/in the past 7 trailing days.\n\nWe calculate this metric by flagging projects who never ran a Cloud invocation prior to the current fiscal year.\nAnd then, for a given week, how many projects in the above population were active that week (i.e. ran an invocation) and of those projects, how many of them had an invocation in dbt Cloud. We then divide those populations to get the conversion rate for that week (see example below).\n\n## Calculations\n**Sources:**\n* **in dbt:** [fct_dbt_invocations](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/model/model.fishtown_internal_analytics.fct_dbt_invocations)\n* **in Looker:** [dbt Invocations explore](https://fishtown.looker.com/explore/dbtLabs/invocations)\n\n**Formulas:**\n* **Core-Only Projects**: Projects that existed before the current fiscal year and _never_ ran an invocation in Cloud before the current fiscal year\n* **Core-Only WAPs**: Core-Only Projects that ran an invocation in a given week or in the past trailing 7 days\n* **Core-Only WAPs using Cloud**: Core-Only Projects that ran an invocation _in dbt Cloud_ in a given week or in the past trailing 7 days\n* **Core to Cloud Conversions**: `Core-Only WAPs using Cloud / Core-Only WAPs` in a given week or at the end of the quarter\n\n## Resources\n* [Link to Data Asset](https://fishtown.looker.com/looks/384)\n* [Link to Googlesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12SKM54CQECjao0TVdNqB7Wcjr_4kz0htfcfiYp6_9Rg/edit#gid=286302974)\n* [Link to OKR Doc](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/O1-Differentiate-dbt-Cloud-b64d52ac2d4d4422912ec5af33f618d5)\n\n## Historical\n\n### Fiscal Year 2023 Overview\n* **Fiscal Year:** 2023\n* **Company Objective:** O1. Differentiate dbt Cloud\n* **Company KR #:** 1.1.2\n* **Company KR Name:** 10% of existing connected warehouses using Core by Q4:FY2023\n\nThis Company-Level KR that cascades from KR1.1.0 (Reach 4,370 net-new Cloud WAPs). From a quantity perspective, we're aiming to see 570 Core-Only WAPs using Cloud at the end of the fiscal year. We define a \"Core-Only WAP\" as a project who _never_ ran an invocation in Cloud before FY2023 (i.e. before Feb 1 2022). Our aim is to ensure that, by the end of FY2023, we're seeing at least 10% of Core-only WAPs using Cloud.\n\n| invocation_start_week | Core-Only WAPs that ran an invocation | Core-Only WAPs that ran an invocation in Cloud | % of Core-Only WAPs Using Cloud |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| 01-31-2022            | 4000                                  | 20                                             | .5%                             |\n| 02-07-2022            | 4300                                  | 35                                             | .8%                             |\n| 02-14-2022            | 4600                                  | 31                                             | .67%                            |\n| 02-21-2022            | 4450                                  | 34                                             | .76%                            |\n\n**Formula Variations:**\n* **Core-Only Projects**: Projects that existed before FY2023 (2 Feb 2022) and _never_ ran an invocation in Cloud before FY2023\n\n### Goals for the Fiscal Year 2023\n| Fiscal Quarter | Fiscal WAP | Cumulative Total | Goal % |\n|----------------|------------|------------------|--------|\n| FY2023-Q1      |         57 |               57 |  1.00% |\n| FY2023-Q2      |        114 |              171 |  2.00% |\n| FY2023-Q3      |        171 |              342 |  3.00% |\n| FY2023-Q4      |        228 |              570 |  4.00% |", "type": "measure_proxy", "type_params": {"measure": {"name": "core_only_WAPS_using_Cloud"}}}
