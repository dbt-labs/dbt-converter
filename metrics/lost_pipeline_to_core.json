{"name": "lost_pipeline_to_core", "description": "## Context\nIn calendar year 2021, 15% (18/119) of lost enterprise pipeline opportunities were lost to \"Another version - dbt Core\". These lost deals are indicative of an under-differentiated dbt Cloud experience. \n\nGoing forward, we will make investments in the product that reduce the rate at which enterprise prospects view dbt Core as a fundamentally competitive offering with dbt Cloud. This will be evidenced by a smaller number of deals being lost to dbt Core (OSS). Note that for this KR, we will be monitoring lost pipeline opportunities specifically.\n\n## Definition\nWe take the total pipeline opportunities that were lost due to dbt Core over the total number of pipeline opportunities that were open during a given quarter.\n\n## Calculations\n**Sources:**\n* **in dbt:** [fct_opportunity_history](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/model/model.fishtown_internal_analytics.fct_opportunity_history) model\n* **in Looker:** [Salesforce Opportunities explore -> Opportunity History](https://fishtown.looker.com/explore/dbtLabs/salesforce_opportunities)\n\n**Formulas:**\n* **Pipeline Opportunities:** Opportunities that reached the `discover` stage (i.e. when `discover_at` is not null)\n* **Lost Opportunities to Core:** `Total Pipeline Opportunities where Lost Sub-Reason = 'Core (Open Source)'`\n* **Lost Opportunities to Core %:** `Total Lost Opportunities to Core / Total Pipeline Opportunities in a given period`\n\n## Resources\n* [Link to Data Asset](https://fishtown.looker.com/looks/380)\n* [Link to Googlesheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJUNJGxv68ugT9VcTiTZthmBTNbXrnXygwHvputklNE/edit#gid=1594525499)\n* [Link to OKR Doc](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/O1-Differentiate-dbt-Cloud-b64d52ac2d4d4422912ec5af33f618d5)\n\n# Historical\n\n### Fiscal Year 2023 Overview\n* **Fiscal Year:** 2023\n* **Company Objective:** O1.
