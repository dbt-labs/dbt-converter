{"name": "weekly_active_projects", "description": "The running total of dbt Projects with at least one invocation in the last trailing 7 days for any given day.\n## Context\nIn the first 5 years of dbt\u2019s existence, usage (measured by WAPs) tripled annually. In its sixth year, 2021, growth in usage has slowed down to 2.5x. We [project that WAP will grow even slower next year](https://app.hex.tech/fishtown/app/2fa79764-fb36-4d93-a97f-f4b043a99f75/latest) \u2014 around 1.5x \u2014 unless we take action to address this.\nIn the early days, dbt was riding the wave of the modern data stack. We experienced rapid growth alongside the rise of Snowflake. By the end of 2021, Snowflake had ~5000 customers and approximately 3,200 of them were dbt users. This is impressive market share that we intend to replicate in the other major warehouses, but it isn\u2019t possible to triple again inside that same Snowflake customer base. \nThis objective aligns product, partnerships, community, and marketing efforts around growing dbt adoption among a shortlist of warehouse providers.\n## Definition\n* WAPs = Weekly Active Project. \"Active\" means a project ran an invocation (i.e. dbt run/build/test/etc in dbt Core and/or Cloud) within the past week/in the past 7 trailing days.\n## Calculations\nThere are two ways you can calculate WAPs:\n**in dbt:**\n* via [fct_dbt_invocations](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/model/model.fishtown_internal_analytics.fct_dbt_invocations)\n    * `Total Distinct Projects by Invocation Started Week`\n* via [fct_dbt_project_activity](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/model/model.fishtown_internal_analytics.fct_dbt_project_activity):\n    * `sum(t7d_active) by Date Day`\n* via [metrics](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/model/model.fishtown_internal_analytics.metrics)\n    * metric_name = 'new WAPs'\n    * `sum(metric_value) by Date Day/Week/Month` -- Note: this gives you the new dbt WAPs. To get an idea of the cumulative total, you'll want to do a `sum(metric_value) over (partition by metric_name order by date_day rows between unbounded preceding and current row)`. However, you cannot filter the dates.\n    * This metric model is great for comparing the current metric value vs the daily goals we set for a given fiscal year. We suggest using the Metrics Dashboard (linked below) rather than writing the query.\n**in Looker:**\n* [dbt Invocations explore](https://fishtown.looker.com/explore/dbtLabs/invocations)\n    * Started At Week || Count Distinct Projects\n* [dbt Project Activity explore](https://fishtown.looker.com/explore/dbtLabs/dbt_project_activity)\n    * Date Week || WAPs\n* [Metric Dashboard](https://fishtown.looker.com/dashboards/86?Metric+Name=new+dbt+WAPs)\nThe first allows you to see all projects that ran an invocation in a given week while the latter allows you to see WAPs on a daily level because it looks at projects that ran an invocation in the past 7 days.\nIf you want to see weekly WAPs actuals vs. the daily goals, then we recommend using the metrics table. You can see what this looks like under the `Resources -> Data Assets` section below.\n## Resources\n* [Link to Data Asset - WAPs Overall](https://fishtown.looker.com/looks/382)\n* [Link to Data Asset - WAPs by Adapter](https://fishtown.looker.com/looks/323)\n* [Link to Googlesheet  WAPs Overall](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qjNMZaPltWCqKgkA6IzOnGD_4ehWBrs99YkklGahA6M/edit#gid=953924585)\n* [Link to Googlesheet - WAPs by Adapter](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WmFMOzl4yaVI_VpF3TguVi1tYzwzu9YdN9lkQhXfXlU/edit#gid=2123183963)\n* [Link to OKR Doc](https://www.notion.so/dbtlabs/O4-Increase-marketshare-within-total-addressable-market-be6f1ff7a37c43f499ba78fed6648b24)\n## Historical\nBefore the usual holiday dip, we closed FY2022 at 8,158 WAP. In FY2022, we will aiming to grow WAP more than 2x \u2014 targeting 17,000 WAP. \nBased on our [best assumptions of existing market share and what we know about prior growth rates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WRg5zQyAdivd1k9UxMNAHvHkGV6r7UEh5xVUCDcUO9s/edit#gid=0), we expect our top 5 growth areas to be: \n- 4,800 weekly active dbt projects on Snowflake\n- 4,500 weekly active dbt projects on BigQuery\n- 1,700 weekly active dbt projects on Redshift\n- 1,200 weekly active dbt projects on Spark & Databricks combined\n- 800 weekly active dbt projects on SQL Server & Azure SQL\n### Fiscal Year 2023 Overview\n* **Fiscal Year:** 2023\n* **Company Objective:** O4.
