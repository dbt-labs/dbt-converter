  Company-Level KR that cascades from KR1.1.0 (Reach 4,370 net-new Cloud WAPs). From
  a quantity perspective, we're aiming to see 570 Core-Only WAPs using Cloud at the
  end of the fiscal year. We define a \"Core-Only WAP\" as a project who _never_ ran
  an invocation in Cloud before FY2023 (i.e. before Feb 1 2022). Our aim is to ensure
  that, by the end of FY2023, we're seeing at least 10% of Core-only WAPs using Cloud.\n

description: "DORA scores are used by DevOps teams to measure performance over key
  metrics. See dbt docs for scoring. \n\n## Context\nThe [DevOps Research and Assessment
  (DORA) team at Google](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html) conducted
  six years of industry research aimed at identifying key metrics that indicate the
  performance of software development teams. For more details on the latest 2021 report
  and why we chose these parameters, please check out the [DevOps Research: 2021 Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/report_2021_accelerate_state_of_devops.pdf)\n
  \nThey identified four key metrics:\n1. Deployment Frequency: How often does an
  organization successfully release to production?\n2. Delivery Lead Time: How long
  do changes take from first commit to release?\n3. Change Failure Rate: What percent
  of deployments result in a production failure?\n4. Time to Restore Service: How
  long does it take an organization to recover from a production failure?\n\nAlong
  with identifying these metrics, the DORA team created a rubric that scores teams
  as Elite, High, Medium, or Low on each metric.\n\n**Note:** For Deployment frequency,
  if it is the current month and it is incomplete, then we take the trailing X days
  of merged PRs.\nFor example, if it is February, then we take the trailing 28/9 days.
  If it is March, then we take the trailing 31 days, and so on.\n## Definition\nPer
  team, the goal is to score at least 13 out of 15 every month.\n- Elite = 4pt\n-
  High = 3pt\n- Medium = 2pt\n- Low = 1pt\n\nParameters for Scoring:\n* Deployment
  Frequency: # of PRs created per week in a given month\n    * Elite = On-demand (multiple
  deploys per day)\n    * High = Between once per week and once per month\n    * Medium
  = between once per month and once every 8 months\n    * Low = Fewer than once per
  six months\n* Delivery Lead Time:  Avg time it takes to deploy a code change per
  week in a given month\n    * Elite = Less than one hour\n    * High = Between one
  day to one week\n    * Medium = Between one day and six months\n    * Low = More
  than 6 months\n* Merge Failure Rate: # of PRs that caused a bug (i.e. unwanted behavior)\n\
  \    * Elite = 0-15%\n    * Low = 16-30%\n    * Note: If a team has more than 30%
  of the last 90 merged PRs as failures, then they will receive a 0. This should not
  be expected, but will be flagged in the Engineering:  DORA Metrics dashboard (linked
  below under Resources).\n* Time to Restore Services: The avg time it takes for an
  incident to be resolved\n    * Elite = Less than one hour\n    * High = Less than
  one day\n    * Medium = Between one day and one week\n    * Low = More than six
  months\n\n## Calculations\n\n**Sources:**\n* **in dbt:** [fct_github_pull_requests](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/model/model.fishtown_internal_analytics.fct_github_pull_requests)\n

description: "The running total of dbt Projects with at least one invocation in the
  last trailing 7 days for any given day.\n## Context\nIn the first 5 years of dbt\u2019
  s existence, usage (measured by WAPs) tripled annually. In its sixth year, 2021,
  growth in usage has slowed down to 2.5x. We [project that WAP will grow even slower
  next year](https://app.hex.tech/fishtown/app/2fa79764-fb36-4d93-a97f-f4b043a99f75/latest)
  \u2014 around 1.5x \u2014 unless we take action to address this.\nIn the early days,
  dbt was riding the wave of the modern data stack. We experienced rapid growth alongside
  the rise of Snowflake. By the end of 2021, Snowflake had ~5000 customers and approximately
  3,200 of them were dbt users. This is impressive market share that we intend to
  replicate in the other major warehouses, but it isn\u2019t possible to triple again
  inside that same Snowflake customer base. \nThis objective aligns product, partnerships,
  community, and marketing efforts around growing dbt adoption among a shortlist of
  warehouse providers.\n## Definition\n* WAPs = Weekly Active Project. \"Active\"
  means a project ran an invocation (i.e. dbt run/build/test/etc in dbt Core and/or
  Cloud) within the past week/in the past 7 trailing days.\n## Calculations\nThere
  are two ways you can calculate WAPs:\n**in dbt:**\n* via [fct_dbt_invocations](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/model/model.fishtown_internal_analytics.fct_dbt_invocations)\n\
  \    * `Total Distinct Projects by Invocation Started Week`\n* via [fct_dbt_project_activity](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/model/model.fishtown_internal_analytics.fct_dbt_project_activity):\n\
  \    * `sum(t7d_active) by Date Day`\n* via [metrics](https://cloud.getdbt.com/accounts/1/jobs/940/docs/#!/model/model.fishtown_internal_analytics.metrics)\n\
  \    * metric_name = 'new WAPs'\n    * `sum(metric_value) by Date Day/Week/Month`
  -- Note: this gives you the new dbt WAPs. To get an idea of the cumulative total,
  you'll want to do a `sum(metric_value) over (partition by metric_name order by date_day
  rows between unbounded preceding and current row)`. However, you cannot filter the
  dates.\n    * This metric model is great for comparing the current metric value
  vs the daily goals we set for a given fiscal year. We suggest using the Metrics
  Dashboard (linked below) rather than writing the query.\n**in Looker:**\n* [dbt
  Invocations explore](https://fishtown.looker.com/explore/dbtLabs/invocations)\n\
  \    * Started At Week || Count Distinct Projects\n* [dbt Project Activity explore](https://fishtown.looker.com/explore/dbtLabs/dbt_project_activity)\n\
  \    * Date Week || WAPs\n* [Metric Dashboard](https://fishtown.looker.com/dashboards/86?Metric+Name=new+dbt+WAPs)\n
  The first allows you to see all projects that ran an invocation in a given week
  while the latter allows you to see WAPs on a daily level because it looks at projects
  that ran an invocation in the past 7 days.\nIf you want to see weekly WAPs actuals
  vs. the daily goals, then we recommend using the metrics table. You can see what
  this looks like under the `Resources -> Data Assets` section below.\n## Resources\n

  ## Historical\nBefore the usual holiday dip, we closed FY2022 at 8,158 WAP. In FY2022,
  we will aiming to grow WAP more than 2x \u2014 targeting 17,000 WAP. \nBased on
  our [best assumptions of existing market share and what we know about prior growth
  rates](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WRg5zQyAdivd1k9UxMNAHvHkGV6r7UEh5xVUCDcUO9s/edit#gid=0),
  we expect our top 5 growth areas to be: \n- 4,800 weekly active dbt projects on
  Snowflake\n- 4,500 weekly active dbt projects on BigQuery\n- 1,700 weekly active
  dbt projects on Redshift\n- 1,200 weekly active dbt projects on Spark & Databricks
  combined\n- 800 weekly active dbt projects on SQL Server & Azure SQL\n### Fiscal
